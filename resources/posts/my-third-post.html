    The Boston Bruins are a professional ice hockey team based in Boston. They
    compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Atlantic
    Division in the Eastern Conference. The team has been in existence since
    1924, making them the third-oldest active team in the NHL, and the oldest to
    be based in the United States. They are one of the Original Six teams, along
    with the Detroit Red Wings, Chicago Blackhawks, Montreal Canadiens, New York
    Rangers, and Toronto Maple Leafs. The Bruins have won six Stanley Cup
    championships, tied for fourth-most of any team with the Blackhawks, and
    tied for second-most for an NHL team based in the United States, also with
    the Blackhawks (after the Red Wings, who have 11).
