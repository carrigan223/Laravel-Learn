    The Boston Celtics (/ˈsɛltɪks/ SEL-tiks) are an American professional
    basketball team based in Boston. The Celtics compete in the National
    Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Eastern Conference
    Atlantic Division. Founded in 1946 as one of the league's original eight
    teams, the Celtics play their home games at TD Garden, which they share with
    the National Hockey League's Boston Bruins. The Celtics are regarded as one
    of the most successful basketball teams in NBA history; the franchise is
    tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for most NBA Championships won with 17
    (accounting for 23.6 percent of all NBA championships since the league's
    founding) and currently holds the record for the most recorded wins of any
    NBA team.[10][11] The Celtics are one of the two charter BAA franchises (the
    other is the New York Knicks) still playing in their original city. The
    Celtics have a notable rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers, which was
    heavily highlighted throughout the 1960s and 1980s. During the two teams'
    many match-ups in the 1980s, the Celtics' star, Larry Bird, and the Lakers'
    star, Magic Johnson, had an ongoing feud. The franchise has played the
    Lakers a record 12 times in the NBA Finals (including their most recent
    appearances in 2008 and 2010), of which the Celtics have won nine.[12] Four
    Celtics players (Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens and Larry Bird) have
    won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for an NBA record total of 10 MVP
    awards.[13] Both the nickname "Celtics" and their mascot "Lucky the
    Leprechaun" are a nod to Boston's historically large Irish population, and
    also to the Original Celtics, a marquee team prior to the NBA.[14]
